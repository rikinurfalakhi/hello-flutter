# Hello Flutter 👋

A Flutter learning project documenting my journey from basic widgets to navigation, forms, and app structure.

This repository is used as a **learning playground** and **portfolio evidence** while I study Flutter and mobile app development.

## 🚀 What I’ve Learned So Far

- Flutter project structure
- StatelessWidget vs StatefulWidget
- Basic layouting (Column, Row, ListView)
- State management using `setState`
- Form & validation (`Form`, `TextFormField`)
- Navigation:
  - `Navigator.push`
  - `Navigator.pop`
  - `Navigator.pushReplacement`
  - Named routes
- Passing data between pages
- Simple login logic (local validation)

---

## 📱 Features Implemented

- Login Page
- Home Page
- Profile Page
- Navigation between pages
- Simple form validation
- UI experiments & widget exploration

## 📌 Notes

This project is **not a production app**.  
It is intentionally structured to show **progress, experiments, and learning steps**.

Future improvements may include:
- Firebase Authentication
- State management (Provider / Riverpod)
- API integration
- Clean Architecture
- Better UI/UX
